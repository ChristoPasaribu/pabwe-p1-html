<h3><strong>COMPUTING</strong></h3>

<h1><strong>3 GPUs you should avoid buying right now</strong></h1>
<p>By <a href="">Monica J. White</a> June 5,2025 11:00 AM</p>

  Shopping for one of the best graphics cards is a minefield right now. It’s not
  that the latest generation is bad (that’s a different subject entirely), it’s
  that the prices still haven’t gone back to normal, despite it being a few
  months since these GPUs first surfaced. If you have an unlimited budget, then
  of course, you can buy any GPU — even the mighty powerful RTX 5090. But if
  you’re trying to squeeze out the most performance-per-dollar, there are some
  GPUs I’d recommend avoiding right now.

<h2><strong>AMD RX 9070 XT </strong></h2>

  Adding the excellent RX 9070 XT to this list is something I’m doing with a
  heavy heart. The GPU received stellar reviews from just about every
  publication that got to try it, and those who ended up buying it largely seem
  happy with it, too. I have no complaints about the performance of this
  graphics card; if anything, it surpassed the expectations that I had for it
  going into the launch of RDNA 4. Capable of rivaling the RTX 5070 Ti, the RX
  9070 XT arrived with a $599 price tag, and at first, it was glorious. Gamers
  flocked to various retailers, with AMD’s Frank Azor sharing a photo of a long
  line of shoppers waiting outside a Microcenter. The consumer market welcomed
  the RX 9070 XT with open arms. Perhaps the welcome was overly enthusiastic,
  though.

<h2><strong>Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB </strong></h2>

<p>
  This was always bound to happen. Nvidia’s RTX 5060 Ti launched in two flavors:
  One with 8GB VRAM, and one with 16GB. The 8GB model starts at $379, followed
  by $429 for the 16GB version. At such a small price gap, it was almost a given
  that most gamers would favor the version with more VRAM, even though they both
  share the same 128-bit interface (which affects their bandwidth, and that also
  means their overall performance). The frame rate gap between the two versions
  of the RTX 5060 Ti might not be as large as it seems, but still, the 8GB
  version is a GPU you should avoid right now. Unsurprisingly, the RTX 5060 Ti
  with just 8GB of VRAM sells at MSRP on Amazon. There are models that sell for
  more, but in general, you can grab it at $379. But, while it can match the RTX
  5060 Ti with 16 gigs of memory at 1080p, it’s always better to have more VRAM
  if possible, and the 5060 Ti 16GB wins most benchmarks at 1440p. If you’re set
  on buying the RTX 5060 Ti, you might as well spend $100 more and get the
  (currently overpriced) 16GB version. But if you want my advice, I’d say wait
  it out and hunt for a 16GB model at MSRP — they do pop up occasionally.

<h2><strong>Intel Arc B580</strong></h2>

<p>
  This is another GPU that I am sad to have to mention on this list. The Arc
  B580 surprised everyone when it launched. Our reviewer called it the “$249
  Nvidia killer,” and who would’ve expected this kind of results from an Intel
  Arc GPU? Knowing the rocky start that the Arc Alchemist generation had to go
  through, many were wary of Battlemage, but Intel surprised us in the best way
  possible. The GPU offered fantastic performance for the inexpensive $250 price
  point — something which is rare right now, at a time when most GPUs cost well
  above $350. Unfortunately (for the buyers, at least), the Arc B580 wasn’t able
  to stay at MSRP for too long. The GPU now sells for $359 to $409 on Amazon,
  and at that price, you’re better off getting the new RTX 5060. If there’s one
  thing these GPUs have in common, it’s that they’re all selling far above the
  price point they were made for. Solid in their own right, they fail to impress
  when they’re suddenly placed one or two pricing brackets above the one they
  belong in. But if sold at MSRP? All three are worthwhile picks. If you’re
  currently buying a GPU, my advice is to keep an eye out for models selling at
  MSRP, and then be quick, because they continue to sell out fast.
